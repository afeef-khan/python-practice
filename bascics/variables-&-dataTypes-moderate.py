# q1. Write a program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.

# x = 10
# y = 20
# x, y = y, x

# print(x, y)

# q2. What is the output and explain the reason:
# a = 5
# b = "5"
# print(a == b)
# print(type(a) == type(b))

# both will be false, because one is number AND other is string

# q3. Predict the output:
# x = 10
# x = x + 2.5
# print(x, type(x))
