# q1. Assign values to three variables (name, age, is_student) using appropriate data types and print their types in a single line output.

# name = "Afeef"
# age = 19
# is_student = True

# print(type(name), type(age), type(is_student))


# q2. What will be the output of the following code and why?
# x = 10
# y = x
# x = 20
# print(y)

# x = 10
# y = x
# x = 20
# print(y)

# answer will be 10 because value of y which when was equated to x was saved as 10 in memory, even if we then change value of x, the value of y will be taken from memory reference of python ehich is 10


# q3. Identify the data type of each value:
# a = 3
# b = 3.0
# c = "3"
# d = True

# print(type(a), type(b), type(c), type(d))
