# q1. Explain and demonstrate dynamic typing in Python using a short program that changes the data type of a variable at runtime.

# a = 10
# print(type(a))

# a = "10"
# print(type(a))


# q2. What will be the output and why?

# a = 256
# b = 256
# print(a is b)


# q3. Given:
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = a
# a.append(4)
# What is the value of b?

# it will be [1, 2, 3, 4] because b = a is a reference assignment not copying
