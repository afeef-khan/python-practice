# q1. Convert a list into a tuple and explain why this might be useful.

# tuples cant be modified as they are immutable and are used for read only

# l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# t = tuple(l)

# print(t)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# q2. Count how many times a number appears in a tuple.

# t = (1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3)
# count = t.count(1)
# print(count)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# q3. Unpack a tuple into variables and print them.

# t = (1, 2, 3, 4)
# a, b, c, d = t

# print(a, b, c, d)
