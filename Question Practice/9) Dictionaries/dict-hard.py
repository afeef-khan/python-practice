# q1. Given a list of numbers, create a dictionary with numbers as keys and their occurrence count as values, but only include numbers that appear more than once.

# -----------------------------------------------------------

# q2. Reverse a dictionary (swap keys and values). Assume values are unique.

# data = {"a" : 10, "b" : 20}
# rev_dict = {}

# for key, value in data.items():
#     rev_dict[value] = key

# print(rev_dict)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# q3. From a dictionary of students and marks, find the student(s) with the highest marks.

# dict = {"a" : 10, "b" : 99, "c" : 54, "d" : 99}
# max_marks = max(dict.values())
# toppers = []

# for name, score in dict.items():
#     if score == max_marks:
#         toppers.append(name)


# print(f"Students with highest marks are {toppers}")
